<p>Researchers have uncovered advanced malware that’s turning business-grade routers into attacker-controlled listening posts that can sniff email and steal files in an ongoing campaign hitting North and South America and Europe.</p>
<p>Besides passively capturing IMAP, SMTP, and POP email, the malware also backdoors routers with a remote access Trojan that allows the attackers to download files and run commands of their choice. The backdoor also enables attackers to funnel data from other servers through the router, turning the device into a covert proxy for concealing the true origin of malicious activity.</p>

<p>“This type of agent demonstrates that anyone with a router who uses the Internet can potentially be a target—and they can be used as proxy for another campaign—even if the entity that owns the router does not view themselves as an intelligence target,” researchers from security firm Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs <a href="https://blog.lumen.com/new-hiatusrat-router-malware-covertly-spies-on-victims/">wrote</a>. “We suspect that threat actors are going to continue to utilize multiple compromised assets in conjunction with one another to avoid detection.”</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922180#p3">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922180&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you're in the market for a Microsoft Surface computer or tablet, now's a good time to grab some deals on the lineup.</p>
<h3><a href="https://shop-links.co/cjgNBnSZW5r" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-orig-url="https://amzn.to/3JgnWMW" data-ml-id="85" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1678126936877fhe">Microsoft Surface Pro 9</a> 13-inch tablet PC with keyboard cover for <strong>$900</strong> (<del>$1,080</del>) at <a href="https://shop-links.co/cjgNBnSZW5r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Buy</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://shop-links.co/cjgNBnSZW5r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surface Pro 9</a> is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/review-surface-pro-9-makes-some-things-better-without-screwing-most-things-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best tablet-laptop</a> on the market. It succeeds in mixing the best of the tablet and laptop experience, being a tablet PC that runs Windows 11, uses a backlit detachable keyboard cover, and is optimized for use with a digital pen (the Surface Pen). It's lightweight and has a smaller footprint than most 2-in-1 laptops while packing enough power to edit media and handle light gaming at higher configurations.</p>
<p>The entry-level Surface Pro 9 (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD) is currently on sale for $900 at Best Buy, down from $1,000, and it comes with a free Surface Keyboard cover which typically runs you an extra $180. That's $300 less than the entry point for <a href="https://amzn.to/3kJDFuc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro</a>, which can't run full programs (only apps) and doesn't include its separately sold Magic Keyboard, which costs $350. This 13-inch Surface Pro model has an Intel i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB storage, which is great for those who simply want a device to edit documents and surf the web without sacrificing the ability to use full programs.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922048#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922048&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On Monday, Microsoft <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2023/03/06/build-solutions-faster-with-microsoft-power-platform-and-next-generation-ai/">bundled</a> ChatGPT-style AI technology into its <a href="https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power Platform</a> developer tool and Dynamics 365, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-expands-chatgpt-integration-more-developer-tools-2023-03-06/">reports</a>. Affected tools include Power Virtual Agent and AI Builder, both of which have been updated to include <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/openai-conquers-rhyming-poetry-with-new-gpt-3-update/">GPT</a> large language model (LLM) technology created by OpenAI.</p>

<p>The move follows the trend among tech giants such as Alphabet and Baidu to incorporate generative AI technology into their offerings—and of course, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/openai-and-microsoft-reaffirm-shared-quest-for-powerful-ai-with-new-investment/">multi-billion dollar partnership</a> between OpenAI and Microsoft announced in January.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Power Platform is a development tool that allows the creation of apps with minimal coding. Its updated <a href="https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power Virtual Agent</a> allows businesses to point an AI bot at a company website or knowledge base and then ask it questions, which it calls <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-virtual-agents/nlu-boost-conversations?wt.mc_id=power-virtual-agents_inproduct">Conversation Booster</a>. "With the conversation booster feature, you can use the data source that holds your single source of truth across many channels through the chat experience, and the bot responses are filtered and moderated to adhere to Microsoft’s responsible AI principles," <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2023/03/06/build-solutions-faster-with-microsoft-power-platform-and-next-generation-ai/">writes</a> Microsoft in a blog post.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922073#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922073&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 1894, a schooner barge called <a href="https://thunderbay.noaa.gov/shipwrecks/ironton.html"><em>Ironton</em></a> collided with a Great Lakes freighter called <em>Ohio</em> in Lake Huron's infamous "Shipwreck Alley." <em>Ohio</em>'s wreck <a href="https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/news/nov17/finding-history-two-lost-wrecks-discovered-in-thunder-bay-national-marine-sanctuary.html">was found</a> in 2017 by an expedition organized by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Now the same team <a href="https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/news/mar23/ironton-discovery.html">has announced its discovery</a> of the wreck of the 191-foot <em>Ironton</em> nearly 130 years after its sinking, so well-preserved in the frigid waters of the Great Lakes that its three masts are still standing, and its rigging is still attached. Its discovery could help resolve unanswered questions about the ship's final hours.</p>
<p>Schooner barges like <em>Ironton</em> were part of a fleet that helped transport wheat, coal, corn, lumber, and iron ore across the Great Lakes region, towed by steamers. At 12:30 am on September 26, 1984, <em>Ironton</em> and another schooner, <em>Moonlight</em>, were being towed unladen across Lake Huron by the steamer <em>Charles J. Kershaw</em> when the steamer's engine failed. The weather was rough, and strong winds pushed the two schooners perilously close to the disabled steamer. Fearing a collision, <em>Moonlight</em>'s crew cut <em>Ironton</em>'s tow line, setting <em>Ironton</em> adrift.</p>
<p>Captain Peter Girard and his crew tried to regain control of the ship, but the wind blew them onto a head-on collision course with the <em>Ohio</em>, which was carrying 1,000 tons of grain. According to the account of surviving crew member William Wooley, it was too dark to spot the <em>Ohio</em> until it was too late, and <em>Ironton</em> struck the steamer with its starboard bow, tearing a 12-foot wide hole in <em>Ohio</em>'s hull.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921935#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921935&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Twitter's revenue and adjusted earnings reportedly fell about 40 percent year over year in December 2022 amid an advertiser exodus following Elon Musk's takeover.</p>
<p>Twitter no longer reports earnings publicly since Musk bought the company and took it private in late October. But Twitter reported the December 2022 revenue and earnings declines in an update to investors, according to "people familiar with the matter" cited in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitters-revenue-adjusted-earnings-fell-about-40-in-month-of-december-ee91f1eb">Wall Street Journal report</a> on Friday.</p>

Twitter <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/twitter-dangles-incentives-to-try-to-lure-advertisers-back/">offered special deals to advertisers</a> throughout December 2022, but it wasn't enough to prevent the 40 percent revenue and earnings declines.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922060#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922060&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft started its Windows Insider program in 2014 to get public feedback on Windows 10 as it was being developed. Ever since then, the company has continued to provide regularly updated prerelease builds of Windows 10 and Windows 11 to preview and test new features.</p>
<p>Like many public beta programs, Microsoft has maintained different channels for different users, with periodic tweaks to each channel's name and stated purpose. Today, Microsoft is <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/03/06/whats-coming-for-the-windows-insider-program-in-2023/">renaming one channel and introducing another one</a>. The one formerly known as the "Dev" channel will now be called the "Canary" channel, and it will be where Microsoft tests its least-stable and most-experimental features (including "major changes to the Windows kernel, new APIs, etc.").</p>
<p>"The builds that will be flighted to the Canary Channel will be “hot off the presses,” flighting very soon after they are built, which means very little validation and documentation will be done before they are offered to Insiders," <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/03/06/whats-coming-for-the-windows-insider-program-in-2023/">writes</a> Windows Insider Program Lead Amanda Langowski.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922038#p3">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922038&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Twitter suffered an embarrassing technology failure today that temporarily broke links to outside websites and even to Twitter's own webpages. The problem lasted for about 45 minutes or so.</p>
<p>In our tests, clicking any link brought up this error message:</p>
<blockquote><p>{"errors":[{"message":"Your current API plan does not include access to this endpoint, please see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api for more information","code":467}]}</p></blockquote>
<p>Clicking that developer link didn't clear anything up while the problem was still happening because it brought up the same API error message. In addition to news articles and other outbound links, the error message appeared when we tried to click Twitter's terms of service, privacy policy, cookie policy, and other similar pages. Some images embedded in tweets were broken, and there were reports of TweetDeck being broken too.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922014#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922014&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AI models designed to closely simulate a person’s voice are making it easier for bad actors to mimic loved ones and scam vulnerable people out of thousands of dollars, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/05/ai-voice-scam/">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
<p>Quickly evolving in sophistication, some AI voice-generating software requires just a few sentences <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">of audio</a> to convincingly produce speech that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-koe-recast-you-can-change-your-voice-as-easily-as-your-clothing/">conveys the sound and emotional tone of a speaker’s voice</a>, while other options need <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">as little as three seconds</a>. For those targeted—which is often the elderly, the Post reported—it can be increasingly difficult to detect when a voice is inauthentic, even when the emergency circumstances described by scammers seem implausible.</p>
<p>Tech advancements seemingly make it easier to prey on people’s worst fears and spook victims who told the Post they felt “visceral horror” hearing what sounded like direct pleas from friends or family members in dire need of help. One couple sent $15,000 through a bitcoin terminal to a scammer after believing they had spoken to their son. The AI-generated voice told them that he needed legal fees after being involved in a car accident that killed a US diplomat.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922001#p3">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922001&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>One of the most honest moments in a new book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZHIDpZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>When the Heavens Went on Sale</em></a>, comes during a discussion between two aerospace technicians working at the rocket company Astra in December 2018. On a Sunday, Les Martin and Matt Flanagan were watching football inside an RV parked at Astra's facilities near Oakland, California.</p>
<p>Martin in particular had a lot of experience at launch companies, having worked primarily on test stands for SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Firefly Space, and now Astra. The two were discussing the challenges of the launch industry and musing about how any company ever made money launching rockets.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Martin</strong>: The challenge is to get there before you run out of money.</p>
<p><strong>Flanagan</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Martin</strong>: Because it doesn't take long. I mean, you raise a little money, you can run through it quick. All the money that is being dumped into this is absurd. There's some charlatans in this business for sure. And what's it all for? I don't see the need for all of it. It doesn't make sense. These VCs made their money in software or whatever. And you know, they just love space. I think a lot of it is it's just cool for them to invest their money in this.</p>
<p>Even with us, the whole goal is for us to launch daily. I'm either going to be dead in the ground before that happens or I'll be walking down the street with money falling out of my pockets and won't care that they're launching daily.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spoiler alert: Astra is not launching daily. In fact, after five failures in seven orbital launch attempts of its Rocket 3 vehicle, the company binned that design. Martin and Flanagan have both been gone from Astra for nearly three years. In hindsight, the exchange offers a succinct and largely accurate summary of the US commercial launch industry's wild ride during the last decade or so. Billions have been invested. We have heard wildly optimistic predictions for launch cadences—such as Astra's preposterous goal of launching daily. Behind it all has been a crap-ton of hard work, sacrifice, and effort, with relatively little to show for it.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921905#p3">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921905&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Apple is readying a new batch of Macs to launch "between late spring and summer," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-03-05/when-is-apple-aapl-releasing-new-mac-pro-15-inch-macbook-air-new-imac-m3-levgn4yc?cmpid=BBD030523_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=230305&amp;utm_campaign=poweron&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman</a>.</p>
<p>The most significant of the three would be a 15-inch MacBook Air, but a new Mac Pro refresh would complete the Mac's transition from Intel's CPUs and AMD's GPUs to Apple Silicon, and a new 13-inch MacBook Air could also be in the cards. Apple is also said to be planning a new 24-inch iMac that could be the first of its Macs to use its next-generation M3 chip.</p>

<p>The 15-inch MacBook Air would be a new product category for Apple: a larger-screened laptop that costs less than a MacBook Pro. Apple's consumer-focused laptops—from the old PowerPC iBook to the first Intel MacBooks to the current MacBook Air—have all ranged between 11 and 13 inches. The 15- to 17-inch PowerBook and MacBook Pro models always required a step up in CPU and GPU power that drove the price up; the cheapest MacBook Air starts at $999, while the cheapest 16-inch MacBook Pro costs $2,499.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921932#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921932&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Researchers on Wednesday announced a major cybersecurity find—the world’s first-known instance of real-world malware that can hijack a computer’s boot process even when Secure Boot and other advanced protections are enabled and running on fully updated versions of Windows.</p>
<p>Dubbed BlackLotus, the malware is what’s known as a UEFI bootkit. These sophisticated pieces of malware hijack the UEFI—short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface">Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</a>—the low-level and complex chain of firmware responsible for booting up virtually every modern computer. As the mechanism that bridges a PC’s device firmware with its operating system, the UEFI is an OS in its own right. It’s located in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface">SPI</a>-connected flash storage chip soldered onto the computer motherboard, making it difficult to inspect or patch.</p>
<p>Because the UEFI is the first thing to run when a computer is turned on, it influences the OS, security apps, and all other software that follows. These traits make the UEFI the perfect place to launch malware. When successful, UEFI bootkits disable OS security mechanisms and ensure that a computer remains infected with stealthy malware that runs at the kernel mode or user mode, even after the operating system is reinstalled or a hard drive is replaced.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921876#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921876&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>When we reviewed the Meta Quest Pro headset <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meta-quest-pro-review-for-those-with-more-money-than-sense/">less than five months ago</a>, we balked at the device's $1,500 price point, which represented a whopping 275 percent price premium over the Quest 2 (with much less than a 275 percent increase in quality). Meta is already taking steps to scale back that massive asking price, though; as of Sunday, the headset <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/price-drop-news/">is now available for $1,000</a> in the US and Canada (a similar price drop will take place March 15 in other Quest Pro countries).</p>
<p>The price drop puts the Quest Pro in line with other high-end headsets, including the untethered $1,100 HTC Vive XR Elite and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/one-week-with-the-valve-index-a-vr-game-changer-with-a-few-question-marks/">the $1,000 Valve Index</a> (which requires tethering to a gaming PC). That said, for practically the same money, you can get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/psvr2-review-plenty-of-improvements-but-is-it-too-little-too-late/">a $550 PSVR2</a> <em>and</em> the $500 PlayStation 5 to tether it to. And the Quest Pro is still 150 percent more expensive than the cheapest Quest 2, which supports almost all the same software and delivers a sufficient VR experience for most users.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Quest 2, Meta has also announced a 14 percent price drop for the 256GB version of that headset, from $500 to $430. That price drop brings that expanded-storage option almost all the way back to the $400 that Meta was charging for it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/meta-quest-2-vr-headset-price-jumps-100-to-399-gets-zero-new-features/">before last year's unprecedented price increase</a>.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921939#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921939&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been more than a decade since Jeff Bezos excitedly sketched out his vision for Alexa on a whiteboard at Amazon’s headquarters. His voice assistant would help do all manner of tasks, such as shop online, control gadgets, or even read kids a bedtime story.</p>
<p>But the Amazon founder’s grand vision of a new computing platform controlled by voice has fallen short. As hype in the tech world turns feverishly to generative AI as the “next big thing,” the moment has caused many to ask hard questions of the previous “next big thing”—the much-lauded voice assistants from Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others.</p>
<p>A “grow grow grow” culture described by one former Amazon Alexa marketing executive has now shifted to a more intense focus on how the device can help the e-commerce giant make money.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921940#p3">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921940&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla is cutting prices for the second time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/tesla-drops-prices-up-to-20-percent-in-attempt-to-drive-sales/">in less than eight weeks</a>. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cuts-prices-model-y-model-x-variants-us-website-2023-03-06/">Reuters noticed</a> that the automaker has dropped the prices of its more expensive, aging Model S sedan and Model X SUV yet again.</p>
<p>While these cars were revolutionary at launch in 2012 and 2015, they now face stiff competition from much newer vehicles from the likes of Rivian, Lucid, Mercedes, Porsche, and BMW. As a result, Model S and Model X sales combined <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/tesla-misses-2022-q4-target-share-price-drops-further/">represented only 5 percent</a> of Tesla's global sales in 2022.</p>
<p>In 2022, a dual-motor all-wheel-drive Tesla Model S went for $104,990. In January, Tesla chopped about 10 percent off the price, dropping it to $94,990. Today, it's another $5,000 cheaper at $89,990.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921920#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921920&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tesla is recalling 3,470 Model Y crossovers built between May 2022 and February 2023 to check that the bolts that secure the frame of the second-row seats are properly torqued. Those that aren't could potentially increase the risk of injury to occupants of the second row during a crash.</p>
<p>For owners worried their cars may be affected, Tesla says that a "second-row seat back frame that has this condition may not fold properly or may be loose and rattle during normal vehicle operation."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921912#p3">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921912&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rivian is in the <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V109-4124.PDF">process of recalling</a> nearly 13,000 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/rivians-67-500-314-mile-electric-adventure-truck-put-to-the-test/">R1T trucks</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/rivians-r1s-is-an-electric-suv-for-those-with-an-adventurous-lifestyle/">R1S SUVs</a> due to a potential seatbelt problem. It believes that in some vehicles, a sensor within the seatbelt system is missized or "dimensionally out of tolerance," which could prevent the automatic locking retractor from working properly. That, in turn, could lead the front passenger airbag to believe the seat was unoccupied during a crash and fail to trigger.</p>
<p>Last July, Rivian and its supplier were investigating a vehicle displaying a message that the front passenger airbag was off despite having a passenger in that seat. Rivian and its supplier, Autoliv, worked on the problem until January, collecting more potentially suspect parts from other Rivian EVs. In February, the startup determined that vehicles with the suspect parts would not be compliant with federal safety regulations and initiated the recall.</p>
<p>Unlike many problems we see on new EVs, this one is not the sort that can just be fixed with a software patch. Although Rivian thinks that only 1 percent of the 12,716 affected cars have a defective part, it will inspect and, if necessary, replace the passenger seatbelt components in those affected vehicles.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921906#p3">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921906&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The US military recently released a rather mundane-sounding <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/2587e0f4a44941e8a96c67c0710efb68/view#20230221">document</a> titled "National Security Space Launch Phase 3 DRAFT Request for Proposals #1." That may be a mouthful of jargon, but it's still a rather consequential document. Effectively, its release is the starting gun for the next round of launch contracts for US spy satellites, secure communications satellites, and more.</p>
<p>There is a pile of money at stake. Up for grabs are launch contracts worth billions of dollars—substantially more than $10 billion—as the military seeks to secure launch deals for the late 2020s and early 2030s. The document itself is pretty bland, but in a follow-up teleconference with reporters, two US colonels overseeing space acquisition, Douglas Pentecost and Chad Melone, provided a trove of information.</p>
<p>Wait! I know this sounds dreadfully boring, but it's really not. Based on the document and this hour-long call, it's possible to get a good sense of where the US military believes the country's launch industry is headed. And that matters because in many cases, the contracts offered by the military can make or break launch companies. For example, after the last round of bidding for national security launches ended, Northrop Grumman <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/09/14/northrop-grumman-ends-omega-rocket-program-after-losing-military-launch-competition/">ended its efforts</a> to develop the Omega rocket.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1920109#p3">Read 44 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1920109&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>New episodes of <em>The Last of Us</em> are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-one/">will be talking about them here every Monday morning</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously <strong>heavy spoilers</strong> contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Up until now, for the most part, I think the <em>Last of Us</em> TV show has done a good job fleshing out the game's story without really ruining the key moments. That didn't really happen with this episode.
<p>In the games, we get a quick cut from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/hope-and-doubt-collide-in-an-eventful-episode-6-of-the-last-of-us/">the events of episode 6</a> to Ellie hunting wild game in the snow. As we take direct control of Ellie for the first time, we don't even know if the unseen Joel is alive or dead.</p>
<p>We also don't know anything about the mild-mannered stranger named David that Ellie stumbles upon while hunting. He even seems like a plausible Joel replacement at points during the early, amenable parts of their in-game team-up.</p>
<p>Seeing everything from Ellie's perspective really heightens the tension and mystery of David's whole arc, and I feel like the show kind of ruined that pacing here.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Even with no knowledge of how this plays out in the game, I agree that this episode felt super rushed and uneven in a way that makes me more frustrated about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/where-a-kid-can-be-a-kid-recapping-episode-7-of-hbos-the-last-of-us/">last week’s flashback episode</a>. Not that last week’s episode was bad at all! But this arc clearly wanted another episode to breathe, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/the-last-of-us-episode-5-asks-what-if-prestige-tv-shows-had-boss-monsters/">the Kansas City arc got</a>. Instead we have to cram all this stuff into a single hour.
<p>David suffers the most. It’s like the show needed to stuff him full of red flags to make sure that viewers really didn’t like him or feel bad for him, but it also makes him into a cartoon character in a show where most of the antagonists have already been a little flat.</p>
</div>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scott-shepherd_0.jpg"><img alt="We are in need of a more interesting characterization..." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scott-shepherd_0-640x427.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scott-shepherd_0-1280x853.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scott-shepherd_0.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">We are in need of a more interesting characterization...</a> (credit: HBO)</p></div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: The whole preacher subplot is completely new to the show, as far as I can tell, as is David's baffling vision of a violent teenager as a partner in leading the flock. I can see why they wanted to give his turn to cannibalism some grounding, but yeah, it's another situation where the red flags are a little too overt.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, in a TV show, there are some places where I am more willing and able to suspend disbelief—like when Joel goes from laid-out-on-his-back-delirious-with-infection to full-on Rambo-killing-spree in the space of 45 minutes. A more realistic recovery would take a long time to show and to watch! Bo-ring!
<p>But I did not believe for even one fraction of one second that Ellie was in any danger of joining up with this creepy fundamentalist/mushroom cultist/child-hitter/cannibal guy, and it makes it weirder that the last sequence between them is framed as this big emotional showdown.</p>
<p>And also... this community had a lot of other people in it? Where did they go? A more organic and satisfying version might have had David’s own community seeing what a creep he is and turning on him, rather than a big dramatic one-on-one confrontation between David and Ellie in the world’s most flammable restaurant. It doesn’t sound like that’s how it goes in the games, but it also sounds like the character is just handled fundamentally differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scott-shepherd-bella-ramsey.jpg"><img alt="Just hanging out..." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scott-shepherd-bella-ramsey-640x427.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scott-shepherd-bella-ramsey-1280x853.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scott-shepherd-bella-ramsey.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Just hanging out...</a> (credit: HBO)</p></div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Not getting any resolution to what happens to this community of people that have now had their cult leader violently killed does seem like a pretty big dangling plot thread.
<p>Here's my main question for someone going in fresh: Did you ever feel like David was potentially just a nice guy and someone that Ellie could justifiably trust and/or let down her guard in front of? I feel like the game went to great pains to push the player in that direction for a while before the heel turn, and it just didn't work for me here. Then again, I knew some of David's dark secrets from the get-go...</p>
</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: I don’t think the audience is meant to believe that David could be a good guy at any point. The scene where you meet him is too full of meaningful looks and ominous pauses, and obvious fear on the part of the other people in the community.
<p>The first scene where David and Ellie meet, on the other hand—I could see it! David (played by Scott Shepherd, a fairly prolific character actor who has one of those “what have I seen him in?” faces) has a certain reassuring avuncular charisma to him. Unfortunately, we’ve already seen too many Bad Guy markers from him, even before you find out that he’s been reading <a href="https://twilightzone.fandom.com/wiki/To_Serve_Man">To Serve Man</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bella-ramsey_16.jpg"><img alt="That gun looks a bit heavy, Ellie..." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bella-ramsey_16-640x427.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bella-ramsey_16-1280x853.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bella-ramsey_16.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">That gun looks a bit heavy, Ellie...</a> (credit: HBO)</p></div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Where this episode does follow the games pretty closely is in leaning more toward the "torture porn" side of the equation than any part of the story so far. Not that there hasn't been plenty of violence previously, but seeing Joel torture and kill two prisoners without any remorse and Ellie's own almost-chopping-and-revenge really takes it to a new level. It also makes you look at both characters in a disturbing new light, I think.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Joel is clearly being driven both by his dawning acceptance of Ellie-as-daughter figure (his “baby girl” when they finally meet back up is extremely loaded) and his established trust-no-one views of life post-apocalypse. But that doesn’t make it any less uncomfortable to watch. This is a dated reference, but I was reminded of Kiefer Sutherland’s Jack Bauer, from the War On Terror-era show <em>24</em>. Sure, he tortures people, and sure, he seems just a hair too enthusiastic about it, but he gets results!!
<p>And you’re right that Ellie’s butchering of David at the end of the episode goes on just a bit too long for comfort. I’m just not sure what to make of it. Surely Ellie has been traumatized as much as she could possibly need to be for story purposes. It’s not as though David was close enough to her to really betray her. Between the two of them, Joel and Ellie do enough violence this episode to sour their tearful reunion a bit. Which is not really where I wanted to be heading into the season finale of a show I have otherwise mostly liked.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: There's definitely a certain "War on Terror" mindset that creeps into the narrative from decades past, for sure.</div>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bella-ramsey_18.jpg"><img alt="Who doesn't love a good stealth section?" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bella-ramsey_18-640x427.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bella-ramsey_18-1280x853.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bella-ramsey_18.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Who doesn't love a good stealth section?</a> (credit: HBO)</p></div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: That was where society ended, something the show occasionally references but doesn’t pick at too much. We’ve had one 9/11 reference and one Pearl Jam album with a lot of anti-Bush stuff on it, so presumably the US had invaded Iraq six months before society fell apart.</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Now I'm wondering if Osama bin Laden's cave hideout was relatively safe from the Infected. Depends how much cordyceps-infused flour they imported, I guess?</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: It does kind of make me want to see more about how the world outside the US is handling the apocalypse. Maybe we would have, back in the old days of 22-episode seasons.</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Which gets into what I think has become a pretty big pacing problem with the show. In the games, new characters would pop in and stick around for a while, and you never knew precisely when they would pop out again (usually with a violent death). Here, the structure means the pattern of "here's a new character, they will be dead by the end of this episode (or maybe the next one)" has become way too obvious...
<p>All that death has been building toward the big finale, though. Without getting too spoilery, I wonder if you even remember what Joel and Ellie are trekking for/toward at this point, and if you have any big predictions for the final episode?</p>
</div>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/troy-baker_0.jpg"><img alt="Oh yeah, Troy Baker is here, too." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/troy-baker_0-640x427.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/troy-baker_0-1280x853.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/troy-baker_0.jpg" class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Oh yeah, Troy Baker is here, too.</a> (credit: HBO)</p></div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: They still have to get her magic blood out to some Firefly-affiliated scientists! The only thing I’m confident enough to assert is that they’re finally going to get where they’re going, and the scientists are going to end up being weirdo creeps who aren’t totally on the level.
<p>I would love to be pleasantly surprised! Maybe the show has settled into this predictable rhythm to make it especially mind-blowing next week when all the scientists end up being super chill and professional.</p>
</div>
<div class="convo kyle"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Not to set your expectations too high, but the conclusion of <em>The Last of Us Part One</em> is what raises it to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/12/the-20-best-and-three-most-disappointing-video-games-of-2013/">the level of "All Time Great" game</a> for me, so I'm looking forward to seeing this team of actors and producers tackle it.</div>
<div class="convo andrew-c"><strong>Andrew</strong>: It’s too late, you’ve set my expectations too high! If I don’t like the finale, it’ll be all your fault.</div>

<p>Kenya is in the middle of its worst drought <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/12/1132047">in 40 years</a>. In the parched north of the country, rivers are running dry and millions of livestock have perished due to lack of food. Around 4.4 million Kenyans don’t have enough to eat, and the situation will worsen if the <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/another-poor-rainy-season-forecast-drought-hit-horn-africa">coming rainy season</a> fails like the previous five. “I’ve never seen it so bad. There’s nothing in the farms, the drought is too harsh,” says Daniel Magondo, a cotton and maize farmer in central Kenya.</p>
<p>The record-breaking drought is forcing Kenya to confront a controversial topic: whether the country should grow genetically modified (GM) crops. These are plants that have had genes from another organism inserted into their DNA to give them a new trait, such as disease or drought resistance. Although GM crops are completely safe to eat and are <a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/what-gm-crops-are-currently-being-grown-and-where/">widely grown</a> in the US, Canada, Brazil, and India, governments in many parts of the world, including Europe and East Africa, have pushed back against them.</p>

<p>Since the invasion of Ukraine one year ago, Russia has faced an exodus of tech companies and services. This includes the exit of Samsung and Apple, two of the world’s most popular smartphone brands. In response, the country has doubled down on its efforts to attain technological self-sufficiency, including creating a new Android smartphone.</p>
<p>The handset, which does not yet have a name, will be built by the National Computer Corporation (NCC), one of Russia’s largest IT companies, with an ambitious goal to sell 100,000 smartphones and tablets by the end of 2023. Alexander Kalinin, the founder of NCC, <a href="https://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2023-02-28_v_rossii_sozdayut_otechestvennye">told</a> local media on Monday that he aims to invest 10 billion rubles ($132.9 million) in the project and hopes to capture 10 percent of the consumer market by 2026.</p>
<p>The news comes just days after the US Department of Commerce <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/420-part-746-embargoes-and-other-special-controls/file">banned</a> exports to Russia of phones and other electronics that cost more than $300. Experts say, however, that a Russian smartphone will have a hard time beating inexpensive competitors from China, and it may encounter problems with using Google’s Android.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921838#p3">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921838&comments=1">Comments</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
